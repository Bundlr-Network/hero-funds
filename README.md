# arfunds

This repository publishes an npm package that allows interacting with `arfunds` contracts on Arweave. Arfunds is a project designed to help communities raise funds for archival projects around major events of historical importance. Each `arfunds` contract constitutes a pool, and keeps track of all contributions made to a particular pool contract. 

A demonstration of the usage of `arfunds` is available at [arfunds-client](https://github.com/abhavk/arfunds-client).

Building the package:
```
npm run build
```
